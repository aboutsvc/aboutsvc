          <p><em>Last Updated July 3, 2024</em></p>
          <p>
            About service Inc. ("Company", "we", "our" or "us"), acting under the Google Play and Apple App Store
            alias About service, understands the importance of protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains
            what information of yours will be collected when you download, install, register with, access, or use this
            mobile application (the "App"), and how such information will be used and shared. It also explains choices
            you have to control the collection, correction and/or deletion of such information.
          </p>
          <p>
            This policy applies only to information we collect in our App and in e-mail, text and other electronic
            communications sent through or in connection with our App. This policy DOES NOT apply to information
            collected in other apps or websites (including third-party websites you may access through the App), or
            information collected by any third party. These third parties may have their own privacy policies, which
            we encourage you to read before providing information on or through them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should you not wish to have your information gathered or used as described in this policy, you may
            uninstall the App from the device(s) on which you have downloaded it.
          </p>
          <h3>
            THE INFORMATION WE COLLECT, HOW WE USE IT, AND THE LIMITED WAYS IN WHICH WE SHARE IT
          </h3>
          <p>
            Information is automatically collected when you use our App. Information collected may include usage
            details, metadata, and real-time information about the location of your device. We do not generally collect
            or store information by which we ourselves may personally identify you ("Personally Identifiable
            Information" or "PII") through the App. Any data is held by service providers and co-operation partners
            only, which are outlined below. Please note, however, that the information we have about you might still
            qualify as "personal data" under the GDPR.
          </p>
          <h4>Analytics Data</h4>
          <p>
            Anonymous data, which we refer to as “Analytics Data,” regarding your use of our App is tracked and
            transmitted to us by our Apps themselves. Analytics Data consists of:
          <ul>
            <li>A device identifier enabling other issues on the same device to be located;</li>
            <li>Crash logs, enabling application failures to be investigated; and</li>
            <li>App interaction signals and event data, typically indicating when an application feature has been used
              ina certain way.</li>
          </ul>
          We use Analytics Data to fix and improve the App and evaluate features, including if and when users use
          different features, and how quickly new features are found. Analytics Data is anonymized, meaning it cannot
          be traced back to you. We process Analytics Data using Google Analytics, Firebase, and Microsoft App Center,
          but do not otherwise share it.
          </p>
          <h4>Advertising Data</h4>
          <p>
            Like many apps, our App is in part supported by advertising. Unless you opt-out, discussed more below, we
            may serve ads to you by transmitting to our select advertising partners a standard advertising identifier
            (an “Advertiser ID”) that we collect from your device. Advertising IDs are standard across the mobile
            advertising industry and are used to identify a particular device for advertising purposes. Advertising IDs
            are random identifiers that are generated by and tied to your mobile device. An example from a Google
            Android device looks like this: cdda802e-fb9c-46af-9846-0233d394c712.
          </p>
          <p>
            Advertising IDs are typically generated once per device, so your device would always be associated with the
            same Advertising ID. Advertising IDs don't contain any Personal Information in and of themselves. However,
            because they are typically static, a device will maintain the same Advertising ID over time, it is possible
            for third parties to use an Advertising ID in conjunction with location data they could collect from your
            device or from other apps you use, and other apps known to be associated with your device's Advertising ID,
            to create inferences about you. Both Apple's iOS or Google's Android operating system provide a mechanism
            for users to reset or disable their device's Advertising ID. If you elect to disable your Advertising ID, we
            respect that choice and will not send your device's Advertising ID to our advertising partners.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our applications transmit a device's Advertising ID without adding any other Personal Information or other
            additional information. We believe this results in an excellent user experience with relevant and helpful
            advertising, while also protecting your privacy and safety.
          </p>
          <h4>
            Purchase Data
          </h4>
          <p>
            When you purchase a subscription or other in-app item from the Apple App Store or Google Play store, that
            transaction is processed by the relevant app store. We have no access to your payment instruments and can
            see only the very limited view of the transaction shared with us by the app store. The limited data we
            receive consists of an order ID generated by the app store, price information, the date and time of the
            purchase, and may in some cases contain your ZIP code of the purchaser. This limited purchase data is only
            used by our support staff to request refunds for you when appropriate, and is not shared with any third
            party.
          </p>
          <p>
            The uses above enumerate the limited ways in which we use the information provided by or collected from you
            and your mobile device when you use our App. If we are required to, we may also use your Personal
            Information to respond to a valid and enforceable court order, law, or legal process.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, reorganization, restructuring, or other sale or transfer of all
            or any portion of our assets or business, that could involve your Personal Information and User Data being
            transferred to the buyer or surviving entity. We value your privacy, and we will, if allowed, use reasonable
            efforts to notify you when your Personal Information is transferred, by posting such notice on our website
            or the App, and/or by contacting you if you have provided us with an email address. In the event of a
            transfer of Personal Information, we will instruct the buyer, surviving entity, or other third party
            recipient that absent your permission to do otherwise it may only use your Personal Information covered by
            this Privacy Policy in accordance with this Privacy Policy, even after the transfer. However, following such
            transfer we cannot guarantee or enforce that any such third-party will abide by our instruction. Any new
            information you provide after any such transfer will likely be subject to a new policy, and you should
            review that policy.
          </p>
          <h3>THIRD PARTY ADVERTISING PARTNERS </h3>
          <p>
            As mentioned, we may provide the Advertising ID associated with your the Apple or Android mobile device to
            the third-party ad servers or ad networks listed below ("Advertisers"). While we do not share any other data
            with your Advertising ID, it is possible for Advertisers to independently collect information about your
            online activities over time and across different websites, apps, and other online services websites by
            tracking your Advertising ID elsewhere. Advertisers may use this information (including the information we
            provide to them) to provide interest-based (behavioral) advertising or other targeted content to your mobile
            device.
          <p></p>
          The App includes the use of the following services:

          <h3>CHOICES ABOUT YOUR INFORMATION </h3>
          <p>
            We strive to provide you with choices regarding the information you provide to us. This section describes
            mechanisms we provide for you to control certain uses and disclosures of your information.
          </p>
          <p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Advertising IDs. You may object to the transfer of your Advertising ID at any given time with immediate,
              future effect by adjusting the settings on your mobile device to, depending on your operating system,
              disable the Apple-Ad-Tracking via IFDA or to opt out of interest-based ads via the Google advertising ID.
              The mechanism for opting of out of interest-based ads is different for each device, so please consult the
              user manual for your device's operating system for specific instructions. Additionally or alternatively,
              you can reset your Advertising ID at any time (and as frequently as you would like), which causes Google's
              or Apple's system to build your device's profile for advertising purposes anew, so that advertisers cannot
              link your activities taking place prior to the reset to your device.
            </li>
            <li>
              Other Tracking Technologies. Depending on your device, you may be able to adjust the settings of your
              device to disable or refuse app cookies and/or other tracking technologies. Please note that we do not
              access your device's do-not-track settings, and we therefore do not respond to such settings. Third party
              advertisers, ad networks, and ad servers that display ads in our App may, however, access and respond to
              your device's and browsers' do-not-track signals; if you would like to know how a third party advertiser
              responds to do-not-track signals sent by your device or browser, please consult their privacy policy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Targeted Advertising by Third Parties. We do not control third parties' collection or use of your
              information to serve interest-based advertising. However, these third parties may provide you with ways to
              choose not to have your information collected or used in this way. In general, to find out more about how
              to opt out of receiving targeted ads from a particular advertiser click on the AdChoices icon or link (or
              similar icon or link) appearing in or near the ad. You can also opt out of receiving targeted ads from
              members of certain ad networks as follows: <a href="opt-out-of-ads-personalization.html"
                target="_blank">Opt out of ads personalization</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
          </p>
          <h3>GDPR PRIVACY</h3>
          <h4>Legal Basis for Processing Personal Data under GDPR</h4>
          <p>
            We may process Personal Data under the following conditions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Consent: You have given Your consent for processing Personal Data for one or more specific purposes.
            </li>
            <li>Performance of a contract: Provision of Personal Data is necessary for the performance of an agreement
              with You and/or for any pre-contractual obligations thereof.</li>
            <li>Legal obligations: Processing Personal Data is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which
              the Company is subject.</li>
            <li>Vital interests: Processing Personal Data is necessary in order to protect Your vital interests or of
              another natural person.</li>
            <li>Public interests: Processing Personal Data is related to a task that is carried out in the public
              interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the Company.</li>

              pursued by the Company.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            In any case, the Company will gladly help to clarify the specific legal basis that applies to the
            processing, and in particular whether the provision of Personal Data is a statutory or contractual
            requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract.
          </p>
          <h4>Your Rights under the GDPR</h4>
          <p>
            The Company undertakes to respect the confidentiality of Your Personal Data and to guarantee You can

              interest as the legal basis for Our processing and there is something about Your particular situation,
              which makes You want to object to our processing of Your Personal Data on this ground. You also have the
              right to object where We are processing Your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes.</li>

              the information to perform a contract with You.</li>
            <li>Withdraw Your consent. You have the right to withdraw Your consent on using your Personal Data. If You

              of the Service.</li>
          </ul>
